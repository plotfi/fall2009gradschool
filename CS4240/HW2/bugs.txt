- printing / concating bools with strings
- doing anything related to nil (passing to function, assigning, etc)
- calling functions with non-string parameters that use those params for something (assigning to an number paramer for example) does not work:
	
- assigning any value inside a function to a function parameter

- bad code generated for functions that return something that are never called (they aren't called so I can't infer the return type so it is void, but we generate code anyways that returns an int or something)

- break statements lead to badly generated code, lli throws an error
- empty blocks (blocks with no code in them) lead the compiler to segfault (eg "if true then end" , or probably even "do end")
- semantic problem: can't do arithmetic operations in functions using function parameters, thinks there is a type mismatch (of unknown to int).
